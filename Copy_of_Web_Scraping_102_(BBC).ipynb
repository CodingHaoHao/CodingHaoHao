              "  'Content': 'Donald Trump\\'s presidential campaign has received $50m (£39.5m) boost from the conservative billionaire Timothy Mellon, a federal filing showed on Thursday.\\nThe Super-Pac fund called \"MAGA Inc\" disclosed to the Federal Election Commission that it took in more than $68m from donors last month. \\nReuters reported that Mr Mellon, an heir of the Pittsburgh-based Mellon banking family, gave $50m. Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.  \\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\\nSuper-Pacs are independent \"political action committees\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden\\'s allies on campaigning in recent weeks. \\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies. \\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\\nMr Bloomberg\\'s contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC. \\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.'},\n",

              "  'Content': 'US radio host Charlamagne tha God says opinion polls suggesting black Americans may flee the Democratic party to vote for Donald Trump may be \"overstated\". \\nIn an interview with the BBC\\'s Americast, he said: \"Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and the inroads he\\'s making with black men, but I don\\'t see it.\"\\nBoth President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have ramped up their efforts to court black voters, as November\\'s White House election looms.\\nPollsters currently predict a tight race decided between a few swing states, where some polls have shown Trump gaining ground among black voters, a key Democratic voting bloc.\\n\"I don\\'t know if those polls are accurate,\" Charlamagne tha God, an influential voice among black Americans, told the BBC.\\n\"I\\'m sure there are some black men that support Donald Trump, but that is not the overall sentiment,\" added the broadcaster, whose legal name is Lenard McKelvey.\\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll suggested that over 20% of black voters in key swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - would back Trump in November. \\nThat signals a deep shift compared to 2020, when 92% of black voters nationally cast their ballot for Mr Biden to help him win, according to Pew Research. \\nBut McKelvey - host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, which boasts over 4.5 million weekly listeners - said that support might be \"a little over-overstated\".\\nThe negative polling for Democrats is more of a signal of black voter frustration than a new voting trend, he added.\\n\"History has shown us that the Democratic party hasn\\'t fulfilled a lot of its promises,\" he said. \\n\"The thing I would always say to the Democrats and President Biden is black people are always yours to lose.\" \\nThe Biden campaign has spent millions of dollars targeting black voters, whom the president recently called the \"backbone\" of the Democratic party at a campaign stop.\\nHowever, inflation, immigration and the Israel-Gaza war have weakened his standing.\\nFormer President Trump, too, has made a concerted effort to win over black voters, from posing with black Americans at a fast-food chain, to inviting rappers on stage during a rally. \\nThere is also speculation that Trump may choose Tim Scott, a black Senator from South Carolina, as his running mate to win over more of the African-American vote.\\n\"Just because you got black skin colour doesn\\'t mean that you will be able to energise black people to run out there and vote for you,\" McKelvey said.\\n\"And Tim Scott is definitely not gonna move that needle with black voters.\" \\nMcKelvey said Trump and Mr Biden are \"the two worst candidates ever in the history of candidates running for president\".\\nAlthough McKelvey did not outright endorse a candidate, he told the BBC: \"I\\'m voting to preserve democracy this year.\" The phrase is often used by the Biden campaign.\\nIn the last election cycle, Mr Biden caused uproar after he said African-Americans \"ain\\'t black\" if they don\\'t vote Democrat. He quickly apologised.\\nBut McKelvey told the BBC\\'s Americast that he has \"never been mad at that statement... because that was his honest opinion, you know\".'},\n",

The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency.\\nBut on Tuesday, California congressman Jared Huffman announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\\nMr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it\\'s a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will.\\n“We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.”\\nHeritage said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”.\\n“House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Kevin Roberts, the foundation’s president.\\n“Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.”\\nThe\\xa0Project 2025 document\\xa0outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\\nIt is one of several policy papers for\\xa0a platform broadly known as Agenda 47\\xa0- so-called because Trump would be America\\'s 47th president if he won.\\nHeritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations.\\nHere’s an outline of several key proposals.\\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”.\\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\\nThe document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.\\n\\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. \\nHowever, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.  \\nOther proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium. \\nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas”. \\nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security.\\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports.\\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\\nProject 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban.\\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\\nUnder the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down.\\nThe document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”.\\nIt proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation\", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, \"abortion\" and “reproductive rights”.\\nThe Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency.\\nSince the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series.\\nProject 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\\nTrump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy.\\nMany of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.'}]"

Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.  \\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\\nSuper-Pacs are independent \\\"political action committees\\\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden's allies on campaigning in recent weeks. \\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies. \\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\\nMr Bloomberg's contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC. \\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.\",\n          \"US radio host Charlamagne tha God says opinion polls suggesting black Americans may flee the Democratic party to vote for Donald Trump may be \\\"overstated\\\". \\nIn an interview with the BBC's Americast, he said: \\\"Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and the inroads he's making with black men, but I don't see it.\\\"\\nBoth President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have ramped up their efforts to court black voters, as November's White House election looms.\\nPollsters currently predict a tight race decided between a few swing states, where some polls have shown Trump gaining ground among black voters, a key Democratic voting bloc.\\n\\\"I don't know if those polls are accurate,\\\" Charlamagne tha God, an influential voice among black Americans, told the BBC.\\n\\\"I'm sure there are some black men that support Donald Trump, but that is not the overall sentiment,\\\" added the broadcaster, whose legal name is Lenard McKelvey.\\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll suggested that over 20% of black voters in key swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - would back Trump in November. \\nThat signals a deep shift compared to 2020, when 92% of black voters nationally cast their ballot for Mr Biden to help him win, according to Pew Research. \\nBut McKelvey - host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, which boasts over 4.5 million weekly listeners - said that support might be \\\"a little over-overstated\\\".\\nThe negative polling for Democrats is more of a signal of black voter frustration than a new voting trend, he added.\\n\\\"History has shown us that the Democratic party hasn't fulfilled a lot of its promises,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"The thing I would always say to the Democrats and President Biden is black people are always yours to lose.\\\" \\nThe Biden campaign has spent millions of dollars targeting black voters, whom the president recently called the \\\"backbone\\\" of the Democratic party at a campaign stop.\\nHowever, inflation, immigration and the Israel-Gaza war have weakened his standing.\\nFormer President Trump, too, has made a concerted effort to win over black voters, from posing with black Americans at a fast-food chain, to inviting rappers on stage during a rally. \\nThere is also speculation that Trump may choose Tim Scott, a black Senator from South Carolina, as his running mate to win over more of the African-American vote.\\n\\\"Just because you got black skin colour doesn't mean that you will be able to energise black people to run out there and vote for you,\\\" McKelvey said.\\n\\\"And Tim Scott is definitely not gonna move that needle with black voters.\\\" \\nMcKelvey said Trump and Mr Biden are \\\"the two worst candidates ever in the history of candidates running for president\\\".\\nAlthough McKelvey did not outright endorse a candidate, he told the BBC: \\\"I'm voting to preserve democracy this year.\\\" The phrase is often used by the Biden campaign.\\nIn the last election cycle, Mr Biden caused uproar after he said African-Americans \\\"ain't black\\\" if they don't vote Democrat. He quickly apologised.\\nBut McKelvey told the BBC's Americast that he has \\\"never been mad at that statement... because that was his honest opinion, you know\\\".\",\n          \"President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November.\\nThe blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump\\u2019s platform.\\nOver more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts.\\nThe Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition has been ramping up as opinion polls show a tight race between President Biden, a Democrat, and former President Trump, a Republican.\\nIt is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama\\u2019s \\u201cideas factory\\u201d during his presidency.\\nBut on Tuesday, California congressman Jared Huffman announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\\nMr Huffman said: \\u201cProject 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that\\u2019s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will.\\n\\u201cWe need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it\\u2019s too late.\\u201d\\nHeritage said Mr Biden\\u2019s party was scaremongering with \\u201can unserious, mistake-riddled press release\\u201d.\\n\\u201cHouse Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,\\u201d said Kevin Roberts, the foundation\\u2019s president.\\n\\u201cUnder the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.\\u201d\\nThe\\u00a0Project 2025 document\\u00a0outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation\\u2019s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\\nIt is one of several policy papers for\\u00a0a platform broadly known as Agenda 47\\u00a0- so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won.\\nHeritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations.\\nHere\\u2019s an outline of several key proposals.\\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control \\u2013 a controversial idea known as \\u201cunitary executive theory\\u201d.\\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\\nThe document labels the FBI a \\u201cbloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\\u201d and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.\\n\\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border \\u2013 one of Trump\\u2019s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. \\nHowever, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.  \\nOther proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium. \\nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \\\"stop the war on oil and natural gas\\u201d. \\nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security.\\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports.\\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\\nProject 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban.\\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\\nUnder the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down.\\nThe document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls \\u201cwoke propaganda\\u201d.\\nIt proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including \\u201csexual orientation\\\", \\u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\\u201d, \\u201cgender equality\\u201d, \\\"abortion\\\" and \\u201creproductive rights\\u201d.\\nThe Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency.\\nSince the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series.\\nProject 2025, backed by a $22m (\\u00a317m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\\nTrump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy.\\nMany of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.  \\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\\nSuper-Pacs are independent \\\"political action committees\\\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden's allies on campaigning in recent weeks. \\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies. \\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\\nMr Bloomberg's contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC. \\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.\",\n          \"US radio host Charlamagne tha God says opinion polls suggesting black Americans may flee the Democratic party to vote for Donald Trump may be \\\"overstated\\\". \\nIn an interview with the BBC's Americast, he said: \\\"Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and the inroads he's making with black men, but I don't see it.\\\"\\nBoth President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have ramped up their efforts to court black voters, as November's White House election looms.\\nPollsters currently predict a tight race decided between a few swing states, where some polls have shown Trump gaining ground among black voters, a key Democratic voting bloc.\\n\\\"I don't know if those polls are accurate,\\\" Charlamagne tha God, an influential voice among black Americans, told the BBC.\\n\\\"I'm sure there are some black men that support Donald Trump, but that is not the overall sentiment,\\\" added the broadcaster, whose legal name is Lenard McKelvey.\\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll suggested that over 20% of black voters in key swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - would back Trump in November. \\nThat signals a deep shift compared to 2020, when 92% of black voters nationally cast their ballot for Mr Biden to help him win, according to Pew Research. \\nBut McKelvey - host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, which boasts over 4.5 million weekly listeners - said that support might be \\\"a little over-overstated\\\".\\nThe negative polling for Democrats is more of a signal of black voter frustration than a new voting trend, he added.\\n\\\"History has shown us that the Democratic party hasn't fulfilled a lot of its promises,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"The thing I would always say to the Democrats and President Biden is black people are always yours to lose.\\\" \\nThe Biden campaign has spent millions of dollars targeting black voters, whom the president recently called the \\\"backbone\\\" of the Democratic party at a campaign stop.\\nHowever, inflation, immigration and the Israel-Gaza war have weakened his standing.\\nFormer President Trump, too, has made a concerted effort to win over black voters, from posing with black Americans at a fast-food chain, to inviting rappers on stage during a rally. \\nThere is also speculation that Trump may choose Tim Scott, a black Senator from South Carolina, as his running mate to win over more of the African-American vote.\\n\\\"Just because you got black skin colour doesn't mean that you will be able to energise black people to run out there and vote for you,\\\" McKelvey said.\\n\\\"And Tim Scott is definitely not gonna move that needle with black voters.\\\" \\nMcKelvey said Trump and Mr Biden are \\\"the two worst candidates ever in the history of candidates running for president\\\".\\nAlthough McKelvey did not outright endorse a candidate, he told the BBC: \\\"I'm voting to preserve democracy this year.\\\" The phrase is often used by the Biden campaign.\\nIn the last election cycle, Mr Biden caused uproar after he said African-Americans \\\"ain't black\\\" if they don't vote Democrat. He quickly apologised.\\nBut McKelvey told the BBC's Americast that he has \\\"never been mad at that statement... because that was his honest opinion, you know\\\".\",\n          \"President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November.\\nThe blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump\\u2019s platform.\\nOver more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts.\\nThe Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition has been ramping up as opinion polls show a tight race between President Biden, a Democrat, and former President Trump, a Republican.\\nIt is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama\\u2019s \\u201cideas factory\\u201d during his presidency.\\nBut on Tuesday, California congressman Jared Huffman announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\\nMr Huffman said: \\u201cProject 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that\\u2019s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will.\\n\\u201cWe need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it\\u2019s too late.\\u201d\\nHeritage said Mr Biden\\u2019s party was scaremongering with \\u201can unserious, mistake-riddled press release\\u201d.\\n\\u201cHouse Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,\\u201d said Kevin Roberts, the foundation\\u2019s president.\\n\\u201cUnder the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.\\u201d\\nThe\\u00a0Project 2025 document\\u00a0outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation\\u2019s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\\nIt is one of several policy papers for\\u00a0a platform broadly known as Agenda 47\\u00a0- so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won.\\nHeritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations.\\nHere\\u2019s an outline of several key proposals.\\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control \\u2013 a controversial idea known as \\u201cunitary executive theory\\u201d.\\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\\nThe document labels the FBI a \\u201cbloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\\u201d and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.\\n\\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border \\u2013 one of Trump\\u2019s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. \\nHowever, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.  \\nOther proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium. \\nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \\\"stop the war on oil and natural gas\\u201d. \\nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security.\\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports.\\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\\nProject 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban.\\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\\nUnder the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down.\\nThe document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls \\u201cwoke propaganda\\u201d.\\nIt proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including \\u201csexual orientation\\\", \\u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\\u201d, \\u201cgender equality\\u201d, \\\"abortion\\\" and \\u201creproductive rights\\u201d.\\nThe Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency.\\nSince the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series.\\nProject 2025, backed by a $22m (\\u00a317m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\\nTrump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy.\\nMany of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.  \\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\\nSuper-Pacs are independent \\\"political action committees\\\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden's allies on campaigning in recent weeks. \\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies. \\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\\nMr Bloomberg's contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC. \\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.\",\n          \"US radio host Charlamagne tha God says opinion polls suggesting black Americans may flee the Democratic party to vote for Donald Trump may be \\\"overstated\\\". \\nIn an interview with the BBC's Americast, he said: \\\"Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and the inroads he's making with black men, but I don't see it.\\\"\\nBoth President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have ramped up their efforts to court black voters, as November's White House election looms.\\nPollsters currently predict a tight race decided between a few swing states, where some polls have shown Trump gaining ground among black voters, a key Democratic voting bloc.\\n\\\"I don't know if those polls are accurate,\\\" Charlamagne tha God, an influential voice among black Americans, told the BBC.\\n\\\"I'm sure there are some black men that support Donald Trump, but that is not the overall sentiment,\\\" added the broadcaster, whose legal name is Lenard McKelvey.\\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll suggested that over 20% of black voters in key swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - would back Trump in November. \\nThat signals a deep shift compared to 2020, when 92% of black voters nationally cast their ballot for Mr Biden to help him win, according to Pew Research. \\nBut McKelvey - host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, which boasts over 4.5 million weekly listeners - said that support might be \\\"a little over-overstated\\\".\\nThe negative polling for Democrats is more of a signal of black voter frustration than a new voting trend, he added.\\n\\\"History has shown us that the Democratic party hasn't fulfilled a lot of its promises,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"The thing I would always say to the Democrats and President Biden is black people are always yours to lose.\\\" \\nThe Biden campaign has spent millions of dollars targeting black voters, whom the president recently called the \\\"backbone\\\" of the Democratic party at a campaign stop.\\nHowever, inflation, immigration and the Israel-Gaza war have weakened his standing.\\nFormer President Trump, too, has made a concerted effort to win over black voters, from posing with black Americans at a fast-food chain, to inviting rappers on stage during a rally. \\nThere is also speculation that Trump may choose Tim Scott, a black Senator from South Carolina, as his running mate to win over more of the African-American vote.\\n\\\"Just because you got black skin colour doesn't mean that you will be able to energise black people to run out there and vote for you,\\\" McKelvey said.\\n\\\"And Tim Scott is definitely not gonna move that needle with black voters.\\\" \\nMcKelvey said Trump and Mr Biden are \\\"the two worst candidates ever in the history of candidates running for president\\\".\\nAlthough McKelvey did not outright endorse a candidate, he told the BBC: \\\"I'm voting to preserve democracy this year.\\\" The phrase is often used by the Biden campaign.\\nIn the last election cycle, Mr Biden caused uproar after he said African-Americans \\\"ain't black\\\" if they don't vote Democrat. He quickly apologised.\\nBut McKelvey told the BBC's Americast that he has \\\"never been mad at that statement... because that was his honest opinion, you know\\\".\",\n          \"President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November.\\nThe blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump\\u2019s platform.\\nOver more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts.\\nThe Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition has been ramping up as opinion polls show a tight race between President Biden, a Democrat, and former President Trump, a Republican.\\nIt is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama\\u2019s \\u201cideas factory\\u201d during his presidency.\\nBut on Tuesday, California congressman Jared Huffman announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\\nMr Huffman said: \\u201cProject 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that\\u2019s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will.\\n\\u201cWe need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it\\u2019s too late.\\u201d\\nHeritage said Mr Biden\\u2019s party was scaremongering with \\u201can unserious, mistake-riddled press release\\u201d.\\n\\u201cHouse Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,\\u201d said Kevin Roberts, the foundation\\u2019s president.\\n\\u201cUnder the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.\\u201d\\nThe\\u00a0Project 2025 document\\u00a0outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation\\u2019s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\\nIt is one of several policy papers for\\u00a0a platform broadly known as Agenda 47\\u00a0- so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won.\\nHeritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations.\\nHere\\u2019s an outline of several key proposals.\\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control \\u2013 a controversial idea known as \\u201cunitary executive theory\\u201d.\\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\\nThe document labels the FBI a \\u201cbloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\\u201d and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.\\n\\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border \\u2013 one of Trump\\u2019s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. \\nHowever, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.  \\nOther proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium. \\nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \\\"stop the war on oil and natural gas\\u201d. \\nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security.\\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports.\\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\\nProject 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban.\\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\\nUnder the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down.\\nThe document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls \\u201cwoke propaganda\\u201d.\\nIt proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including \\u201csexual orientation\\\", \\u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\\u201d, \\u201cgender equality\\u201d, \\\"abortion\\\" and \\u201creproductive rights\\u201d.\\nThe Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency.\\nSince the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series.\\nProject 2025, backed by a $22m (\\u00a317m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\\nTrump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy.\\nMany of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
